Fellow Hentais, I come to you in the wake of recent events to issue a call to reason. Let no hentai deny the perils of our time.

While we battle one another, divided by the petty strife of our common history, the tide of a greater conflict is turning against us, threatening to destroy all that we have accomplished.

It is time for us as hentai and as individuals to set aside our long-standing feuds and unite! The tides of an unwinnable war are upon us, and we must seek refuge upon higher ground, lest we be swept away by the flood.

The E-Hentai is no more. Whatever semblance of unity and protection it once provided is a phantom; a memory. With our enemies left unchecked, who will you turn to for protection?

The devastation wrought by the alien invaders is self-evident. We have seen our homes and communities destroyed by the calculated blows of the Baizuo. We have seen firsthand our friends and loved ones consumed by the nightmarish EU. Unprecedented and unimaginable though they may be, these are the signs of our time.

The time has come, my fellow Hentais, to rally to a new banner. In unity lies strength; already many of the dissident factions have joined us. Out of the many, we shall forge an indivisible whole, capitulating only to a single throne!

And from that throne… I… Shall watch over you.

From this day forward, let no human make war upon any other human. Let no Hentai agency conspire against this new beginning. And let no man consort with alien powers. And to all the enemies of humanity, seek not to bar our way, for we shall win through… No matter the cost.
